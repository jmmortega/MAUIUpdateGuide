# Create project

Write " dotnet new maui -n "Name app" "

Remember this appear in a folder that create, my tip here, change .sln file and move outside this folder, if you need another projects. 

Others projects should be update without problems to .net 6. At least come from PCL system of course... but, I hope you updated your project in the past.
