## Essentials libraries

All essentials libraries it's included inside MAUI in Microsoft.Maui.Essentials namespace no problem using this. Personally I prefer several packages instead of Essentials options. One example it's CrossMedia, the old implementation of Microsoft.Maui.Essentials.MediaPicker. More personalized than MediaPicker if loose your mind.

In my case we use MediaPicker, use of camera in our applications it's not extensive, so if enough
