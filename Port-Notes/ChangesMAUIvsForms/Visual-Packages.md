## Visual nugets

First plugin that can receive a conflict, RG.Plugins.Popup. In this moment are porting to MAUI https://github.com/rotorgames/Rg.Plugins.Popup/issues/684. So seems must be ready when MAUI go to production branch for compatibility [here](https://github.com/rotorgames/Rg.Plugins.Popup/tree/Maui-Compatibility) the branch with MAUI support.
