# Perfomance

When take a look to open source from MAUI and you have a deep experience in Forms and multi platform development, you can get the conclusion that MAUI is a huge refactor to Xamarin.Forms with all experience from Xamarin.Forms.

It's the same thought that have all devs when saw our code and think **"damn, if have time to rewrite all the code, I will improve all this things"**

Also all this port of code that you need doing in your Forms application, it's a good opportunity for you and your project to rethink things.
